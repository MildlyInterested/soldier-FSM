**DONE** 3) Exit hold cover  with Automatic stance [Free]
          -observations: 
          There are NO sqf commands that controls a units stance as a whole,
          when clicking on a group in zeus the "group-stance" shown is not representative
          of the whole group, some of the group-members can have their "unitPos" as Automatic
          and others as crouch, but the zeus-menu will show it as if the whole group is crouched.
          Be aware of this before complaining about it not working. 
          Take the time to observe before complaining.

          I have made 2 functions that triggers every 10 seconds in order to deal with the issue.
          Read "fn_handleGroupStance.sqf" && "fn_handleSuppression.sqf"
          They will spam the auto-stance on every individual unit that is not under fire or performing an action.
