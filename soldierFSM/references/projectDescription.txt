Appraisal - "Soldier.FSM" Alpha 0.1
The beginning of the big thing, to make soldiers value their virtual lives. 

This project will regularily read a unit's total suppression value. We will use the sum of suppression to make decisions in battle. 
Vanilla mechanics dictate the suppression value. 

When a unit is initially suppressed, as in they are now above 0% suppression and below a threshold- the first bullets in an engagement should trigger this 
(Parameter, maximum allowed suppression for flinch response), they will "Flinch". 


A Flinching unit will just initially crouch. (This is a placeholder for potential animations.) 
After triggering, the 'Flinch' response will go into a cooldown before it can trigger again. (Parameter, FlinchCoolDown)

If a unit is initially suppressed by .50 cal weapons or larger, or are nearby an explosion, they will instead immediately dive and go prone as their "Flinch" response. 
This type of flinch is subject to the same parameters as above. 

While a unit is too suppressed, they will stay prone. (Parameter, suppression is above 50%). 
(Note: We will later account for a unit not going prone if they are using cover that doesn't make sense for it. Expect to edit this in the future.)
Use Pinned Down as a reference for the above two features. 

If a unit takes a large amount of suppression in a short time (Parameter, rate of suppression increase needed to trigger), they will "Dodge". 
A unit cannot dodge while flinching. (flinching will eventually be an animation, it's meant to resemble a "Stunned" state.)
A Dodging unit will quickly strafe to one side if they are standing or crouched. 
A Dodging unit will roll to one side if they are prone. 
After dodging, a unit cannot dodge again until a cooldown expires. (Parameter, DodgeCoolDown) 
Use danger.FSM as an educational reference.
